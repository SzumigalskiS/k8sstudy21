Volume can have 3 accessModes:

ReadWriteOnce - define a PersistentVolume that can only be mounted as Read/Write by single PersistentVolumeClaim.

ReadWriteMany - define a PersistentVolume that can be bound Read/Write by multiple PersistentVolumeClaim. This mode is only supported 
                by file and object storage like NFS. Block storage only ssupports ReadWriteOnce

ReadOnlyMany - defines a PersistentVolume that can be bound by multiple PersistentVolumeClaim as Read-Only
